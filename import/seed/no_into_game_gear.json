NERVE - you're behind the wheel of a supertuned race car with one speed only: fast. SKILL - you're maneuvering a car that can nearly reach a simulated 270 KMH. BRAINS - because you're in control of your car's speed and handling at a dangerous pace, you have to use your head and not just your hands to survive. So get geared for the ride of your life and stay alert. The track may look terrific, but at these speeds anything can turn into a danger zone.",
